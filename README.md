## Objective  
The objective of this project is to perform functional testing of RESTful APIs using Postman.  
This project focuses on:

- Testing Authentication APIs to ensure successful login and token generation  
- Testing Data Retrieval APIs to verify that user data can be correctly fetched  

The deliverables include a Postman collection containing all tested APIs and a comprehensive test execution report documenting the test steps, expected and actual results, and pass/fail status.

## Conclusion  
In this project, RESTful APIs were successfully tested using Postman for both authentication and data retrieval functionalities.  
The Login API verified that authentication tokens are generated correctly, while the Get Users API confirmed that user data can be retrieved as expected.  
All test cases passed, and the results were documented in a clear and organized test execution report.  

This project fully satisfies CODTECH Internship Task-2 requirements.
